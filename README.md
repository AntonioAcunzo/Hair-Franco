In this project we will implement a web app to improve the booking system of a hairdresser's business.
The aim is to optimize the worker's time by reducing the number of bookings that until now have been made exclusively by telephone booking.
It is also an advantage for the user who wants to make an appointment, in fact through its use the user has the ability to make an appointment at any time of day without respecting the opening hours of the store.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.
